    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="ul-item">2 eggs, separated</li>
      <li class="ul-item">1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li class="ul-item">2 tablespoons cream cheese, softened</li>
      <li class="ul-item">2 teaspoons Italian herb blend</li>
      <li class="ul-item">1 pinch salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="steps">Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a baking sheet
        with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until foamy. Add
        baking powder and continue to beat until stiff peaks form.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk egg yolks, cream cheese, Italian herbs, and salt in a separate
        bowl until well blended.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently fold cream cheese mixture into the beaten egg whites with a
        spatula until just mixed and yellow. Spoon mixture into about 6 rounds
        of about 3 inches diameter on the baking sheet. Smooth the tops with the
        back of a spoon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Remove
        from the oven and serve warm, or allow to cool.
      </li>
    </ol>
